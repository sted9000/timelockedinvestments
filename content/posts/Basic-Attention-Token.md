Sticking with Web3 for our third investment, Basic Attention Token is the currency of The Brave Browser. [Kevin Rose](https://twitter.com/kevinrose) turned me on to this browser a few years ago and his recent enthusiasm in his podcast with [Brendan Eich](https://twitter.com/brendaneich) on [Modern Finance](https://modern.finance/episode/brave-browser/) is why we are investing.
