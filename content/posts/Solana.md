Our first investment!

Breaking the mold right out of the box, I learned of this crypto project not on Twitter, but on [Modern Finance](https://modern.finance/episode/solana-ceo-anatoly-yakovenko/). Its host [Kevin Rose](https://twitter.com/kevinrose) is deep in the crypto space and a very successful founder and angel investor. His excitement about the project should have been enough to warrant an investment, but then I read the [documentation's introduction](https://docs.solana.com/introduction).

While the technical jargon and details are a bit over my head upon the first read, the idea is clear: A smart-contract blockchain very high throughput. Ethereum, but faster and with lower fees out-of-the-box!

Additionally, the founder had almost zero *scammer* vibe. Which is nice!

$1000 invested on 08/31/21. Locked until 08/31/31.
