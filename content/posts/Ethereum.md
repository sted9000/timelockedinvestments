A boring, but necessary, choice for the second investment of Twitter Timelocked Investements.

### Profile
Paul Graham is the founder of YCombinator, thus he has seen many companies thrive and fail and is connected with some really smart minds. The thing I admire most about him (or at least his online persona) is that he seems to pull off holding a few principles rigidly while also having a truly open mind. He is has the vibe of not giving a flying f*&+ about aesthetics for signalingâ€™s sake (just look at his [personal website](http://paulgraham.com/)). When paulg gives investment {{< strike >}}advice{{< /strike >}} hints, I pull out my checkbook.

### Investment
Having already (largely) missed out on perhaps the investment opportunity of my lifetime (buying Ether at its launch), we aren't going to despair! $1000 invested on 12/08/21. Locked until 12/08/31.
