## In brief
1. There is signal in the noise (Twitter).
1. _Trading_ is a bad idea for the average investor (Timelocked).
1. The investment world is unintuitive and non-linear (Investments).

## In more detail
#### Signal in the Noise
Twitter is a double-edged sword. On one side, there's a lot of chaos, hype, and people pushing their agendas. On the other, there are brilliant minds; minds that have experience building companies, capturing value, and peering into the future.

I have heard that investing is in large part about information asymmetries. 
Part of my hypothesis is that smart, curious, and forward-thinking people on Twitter are providing us with valuable information -- information that is hiding in plain sight, obscured by the overwhelming volume of opinions in the world. 
All that is required to harvest that information is a little scrolling, sorting, and placing our own judgment on hold.

#### Don't Trade or Sell
Speaking personally, I am a horrible trader. Not so much because I have strong opinions that turn out to be wrong, but more so because my interests jump around, and I am short-sighted and lazy.

Speaking more generally, we humans have a host of biases and motivations that cause us to be horrible traders: Recency bias, short-term capital crunches, negativity bias, sunk cost fallacy, and the list goes on.

Part of my hypothesis is that locking up investments and throwing away the key for 10 years will outperform most other forms of trading by the casual investor (read: me).

#### Non-Linear Returns
Venture capital firms hope a single investment _returns the entire fund_. This means that we should not focus on how many losers we invest in, but rather on not missing the investment that returns 1000x. Of course this principle requires a bit of nuance and taken to extremes can be absurd. 

Part of my hypothesis is that this trend will continue if not accelerate for the foreseeable future. We will make many investments, most of which will end up worthless. Say we make 50 bets over the course of this experiment, 49 go to $0, and 1 1000x's... well, that's a lot of saying "I was wrong on that one", but also quite a nice return.
